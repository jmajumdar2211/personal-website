# In a Nutshell

**Translating clinical and market research to build tangible, sustainable healthcare innovations that bridge the gaps in current care protocols. That is Joshita’s raison d’être.**

# About Joshita

As a Biomedical Engineer, Joshita gained first hand experience designing, integrating and deploying digital interventions for preventive healthcare at India’s largest healthcare provider. This experience of working with a variety of medical technology providers inspired her transition to developing scalable innovations for improving accessibility and quality of care. 

Once in the research & development space, there was no looking back for her! From conceptualizing, developing and testing solutions for breast and cervical cancer screening, to personalized Parkinson’s disease management, Joshita aims to improve the quality of life for people with chronic diseases.

Not to brag, but she’s worked with doctors, software developers, hardware engineers, product designers and researchers throughout her professional career . Plus, evaluating medical technology solutions with a team of highly experienced doctors really teaches one what doctors want vs what they say. 

So, translation of formal requirements, unstated expectations, knowledge and stakeholder management to deliver the most optimal solution for better health outcomes is her bread and butter.
