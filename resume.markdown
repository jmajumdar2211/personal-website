# Deployment/Program Management

## Apollo Tele Health Services
<sup>Apollo Hospitals Group (India’s largest Private Healthcare Provider)</sup>

**Revolutionizing healthcare access (in low resource settings) through digital interventions**

- Deployed systems integrating connected medical devices, digital health platforms & IoT and cloud based devices across rural, semi-urban and urban markets to improve sustainability and scalability of the Indian healthcare ecosystem
- Identified, evaluated, and integrated Point of Care devices for preventive healthcare interventions in under-served regions

**Achievements**

- **[Pioneering the use of point of care devices and Telemedicine to improve access to care](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/health-it/access-to-telemedicine-throughout-the-country-with-the-launch-of-sehat/48669942)**
    
  
    
    I led the commissioning of [India’s first ever ‘Digital Vital Monitor’ at SEHAT-INDIA (Government of India’s Telemedicine initiative)](http://www.amzbolt.com/news/2016/HNG-limited-advances-its-remote-helathcare-initiative-with-control-H-Helath-Monitoring-device-from-American-Megatrends.aspx/1000)  at [rural government service centres and trained 100+ non-medical personnel in the use of the point of care device and telemedicine solution.](  https://www.apollohospitals.com/apollo-in-the-news/government-s-new-health-initiative-sehat-launched-in-association-with-apollo-hospitals/)
    
- **Helping limit the spread of infectious diseases**
    
    Rapid detection of vector borne diseases such as Malaria and Dengue is still a huge challenge in low resource settings which suffer from infrastructure and personnel shortages. In 2016, my team collaborated with Fio Corporation in Canada to use the [Deki Reader](https://www.fio.com/) for Automated rapid detection with quality controls that reduced diagnosis error by 30%. This solution was successfully piloted at 12 clinics, 2 hospitals, servicing 500 patients in < 2 months.
    

- I conceptualized, designed & implemented a [pilot program for a Prescription Digitization solution which received funding by the International Finance Corporation (IFC)](https://techemerge.org/innovators/mtava/)


**[Collaborations for Preventive Healthcare interventions](https://www.expresshealthcare.in/news/apollo-tele-health-in-association-with-landmark-group-organises-free-screening-camps/378336/)**

- I introduced a [non invasive haemoglobin testing device](https://truehb.com/) with 99% clinical efficacy leading to 30% cost reduction  for a joint [Non Communicable disease screening CSR program](https://atnf.org/get-active-program/) serving more than 100,000 people.
- My initiative to drive early detection of Breast Cancer using a [non invasive point of care device](https://www.ibreastexam.com/) was launched as a part of the Get-Active program.
